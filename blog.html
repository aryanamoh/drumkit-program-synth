    <h1>Drumkit Cellular Automata Details</h1>

    <p>
        This project was inspired by <a href="https://playgameoflife.com/">John Conway's Game of Life</a>. 
        Using Conway's rules, I designed a cellular automaton that creates a drum beat based on the number of live cells at any given point.
    </p>

    <p>
        To display this implementation of Conway's cellular automaton grid, I start by creating a 2D array
        that represents the grid and contains the life status of each cell. When the user first starts the 
        animation, each cell status is randomly set to alive or dead. 
        When the grid enters its next iteration, we follow Conway's rules to determine which cells 
        should stay alive, stay dead, come alive, or become dead. 
        
        <br>
        <br>
        Conway's rules are as follows: <br>

        1. Each live cell with one or no neighbors dies, as if by solitude. <br>
        2. Each live cell with four or more neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation. <br>
        3. Each live cell with two or three neighbors survives. <br>
        4. Each dead cell with three neighbors becomes populated. <br> <br>

        These rules dictate which cells with be alive in the next iteration, and the 
        number of live cells in each iteration dictates what the drum beat will sound like.
        A kick drum sound plays every iteration of the automaton. 
        On top of that kick drum, a combination of hi-hat and snare sounds plays.
        Different combinations played when 10-20% of cells are alive, vs when 20-30% of cells are alive, and so on.
        These drum sounds are synthesized with the Web Audio API.  <br> <br>

        The kick drum sound is made with two oscillators of different waveforms (triangle and sine). 
        These two waves are combined by additive synthesis to produce the kick drum sound.
        However, even more crucial to the sound than the oscillators is the use of gain nodes 
        and enveloping. The kick drum sound features a quick and loud attack, followed by a longer, but still
        quick release. This is achieved by ramping up and down the gain values exponentially. <br> <br>

        The snare drum sound is a bit more complex. For this sound, I create and then filter white noise. 
        I filter the white noise with a high pass filter to create that crisp, high pitched snare drum sound.
        I bring in an additional oscillator to the mix to add a bit more depth to the sound.
        This oscillator is combined with the filtered white noise through additive synthesis. 
        Similar to the kick drum sound, both of these noise sources are enveloped to get the 
        quick attack and release that a snare drum sound requires. <br> <br>

        The hi-hat sound is much more complex to synthesize than the previous two drum sounds. 
        It required putting together six oscillator with additive synthesis. 
        All of this sound is put through a band pass filter to get frequencies all around 10,000 Hz.
        Then, this is piped through a high pass filter to keep only sounds above 7,000 Hz.
        Again, a gain node is used to control the enveloping. Similar to the drum sounds, 
        the hi-hat sounds require a very quick attack and release. <br> <br>

        Here are the audio connection graphs for each synthesis: <br>

        This project was developed in Mark Santolucito's Computational Sound class at Barnard College.
        Concepts learned from class include program synthesis and cellular automata. 
        Code techniques from class included enveloping and using filters to alter sounds. 
        In addition to this, I learned how to synthesize drum sounds with help from 
        <a href="https://dev.opera.com/articles/drum-sounds-webaudio/">Chris Lowis</a> 
        and <a href="http://joesul.li/van/synthesizing-hi-hats/">Joe Sullivan</a>. 
        This project also required learning about many HTML and CSS elements with help from 
        <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">W3Schools</a>.
